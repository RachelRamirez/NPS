The goal of the NPS package is to allow a user to explore the original NPS geospatial data and the cleaned NPS data according to assumptions/imputations made.  

## NPS Inputs

One can use the different inputs available on the sidebar of the shiny app to explore the data. The descriptions of most of the geospatial data are available from the NPS Report "Explanatory Variable Generation for Geospatial Sound Modeling" available here: http://irma.nps.gov/App/Reference/Welcome and the Natural Resource Publications Management website (http://www.nature.nps.gov/publications/nrpm/) search for ''Explanatory variable generation for geospatial soundscape modeling: Standard operating procedure. Natural Resource Report. Natural Resource Report NPS / NRSS / NRR \â€” 2015 / 936'' by Lisa Nelson, Michelle Kinseth, and Thomas Flowe.
